# React Native Login UI App

This is a React Native App to show my first contact with Tailwind CSS + React Native components, and made some animations
using Layout Animation by Reanimated.

Project created with Expo CLI. [See official docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) to set up the environment.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used 

The following tools were used to build the project:

- [Expo](https://expo.io/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/): Routes and navigation
- [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/): React Native Reanimated is a powerful animation library.
- [Native Wind](https://www.nativewind.dev/): NativeWind uses Tailwind CSS as scripting language to create a universal style system for React Native. NativeWind components can be shared between platforms and will output their styles as CSS StyleSheet on web and StyleSheet.create for native.
